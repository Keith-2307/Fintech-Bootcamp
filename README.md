# TITLE: Insurance (InsurTech)

## Overview and Origin:

	The insurance industry in North America has seen a significant rise in claims being paid out to the clients because of cancer. With an alarming rate of nearly 1 in 2 Canadians (45% of men and 43% of women) is expected to develop cancer during their lifetime which gives rise to the further alarming statistics of 1 in 4 Canadians (26% of men and 23% of women) are expected to die from cancer. 

This overall burden of cancer remains hi in Canada and or into the growing an agent population the number of cases undeath will likely continue to increase additional efforts to improve uptake of existing programs as well as to Advanced Research prevention screening and treatment are needed. This alarming rate of cancer has led to a significant decline in profits being recognized by the insurance companies in North America and that is because of one product called critical illness insurance where the premiums are being paid as a protection against suffering a critical illness. Cancer however has proven to be treatable if detected early therefore the payments being made by the insurance companies could be significantly reduced hence the introduction of the insurtech company Lazarus AI.

not only are companies recognizing a significant loss in their profit margin the financial impact is also experienced by the families of the recently diagnosed individual more often individuals have to tap into their savings to provide for their treatment and care while supporting their families this has become a bit challenging and cumbersome as the diagnose individual can no longer attend work on a full time basis this could all be rectified by the onset of the Lazarus a I model which proves that early diagnosis reduces the mortality rate to sub 4% from the current 45%.

With the rising numbers of skin cancers around the world, the need to accurately diagnose such cancers for optimal healthcare utilization is paramount. There is currently no global benchmark to quantitate a physician’s diagnostic accuracy and subsequent need to biopsy. Especially in resource-deficient areas, identifying who truly needs a biopsy can help expedite treatment and save costs. In recent years, researchers have investigated the use of deep-learning AI algorithms for skin lesion classification and cancer detection. A system that can be used in real-time in the clinical setting by the physician can not only help the patient but ultimately the healthcare system, which is now being made possible by Lazarus Clinical Decision Support platform, and in turn save lives as and early detection of cancer helps in decreasing mortality saving costs of treatment care reduces claims being paid out by insurance companies and finally facilitating they required lifestyle after diagnosis.

Lazarus Clinical Decision Support (LCDS) is an artificial intelligence (AI) model that is designed to classify skin lesion and detect skin cancer from a skin image. It can help support physicians by providing a fast and reliable preliminary screening tool for skin cancer. It is not intended to be used as a replacement for definitive diagnostic such as skin biopsies or override a physician’s diagnosis.


* Name of company: LAZARUS AI

* When was the company incorporated?
Lazarus AI, was incorporated in December 2019.

* Who are the founders of the company?
Lazarus was Founded on Oct 4, 2017 by Ariel Elizarov


* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Lazarus AI uses patient health data and AI to detect cancer early. The company has clinical decision support systems for skin and cervical cancer, which help improve the diagnostic accuracy of physicians. This idea came from its founder recognition of the need for a mechanism which can be used to accurately diagnosed skin and ovarian cancer (to begin with) early for optimal healthcare utilization which is paramount. It is understood that Elizarov believes that his Fintech start-up will eventually be used to diagnose other forms of cancer at an exceedingly early stage and thus facilitating underwriters in determining the best and implementing an insurance plan that is not only for the present but the future. As mentioned earlier, Elizarov further understood that since there is currently no global benchmark to quantitate a physician’s diagnostic accuracy and subsequent need to biopsy. Especially in resource-deficient areas, identifying who truly needs a biopsy can help expedite treatment and save costs. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Lazarus has raised a total of $2.4M in funding over 3 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Jan 23, 2020 from a Convertible Note round. Prior to this round, the company raised funds from 2 Pre-seed rounds on July 15, 2019 and March 1, 2019 where the sum raised were $450,000 and $150,000 respectively, from various investors. 

Convertible notes which are the preferred funding methods for start-ups, is short-term debt that converts into equity.  In the context of a seed financing, the debt typically automatically converts into shares of preferred stock upon the closing of a Series A round of financing. In other words, investors loan money to a start-up as its first round of funding; and then rather than get their money back with interest, the investors receive shares of preferred stock as part of the start-up’s initial preferred stock financing, based on the terms of the note.

Convertible notes are preferred due to the speed, simplicity and cost associated with acquiring the funds. Indeed, a start-up could close a convertible note round in a day or two by merely issuing a 2–3-page promissory note, which could cost as little as $1,500-$2,000 in legal fees (or a little more if a note purchase agreement is also executed, which is customary). On the other hand, the issuance of shares of preferred stock is complex, and it can take weeks to negotiate all the terms and documents — with legal fees about $10,000 – $30,000 or more.

With regards to the first funding methods used, Pre-Seed rounds is simply a pre-institutional seed round that either has no institutional investors or is an exceptionally low amount, often below $150k.” The pre-seed round gives a start-up the opportunity to continue developing a product and create a plan to generate significant revenue. 

One of the interesting aspects of raising a pre-seed round is the lack of traction and metrics you will likely have. A later stage fundraise will likely revolve around metrics, financials, and data (on top of your product, market, and team) but a pre-seed round will revolve around concepts and vision.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Lazarus CDS was built with the input from dermatologist, patients, and clinical support staff to ensure they have the features they need most since There is currently no global benchmark to quantitate a physician’s diagnostic accuracy and subsequent need to biopsy. Especially in resource-deficient areas, identifying who truly needs a biopsy can help expedite treatment and save costs. Furthermore, the huge financial lost being recognized by not only the insurance companies who have to payout claims from various insurance products on offer, but the individual patients who must liquidate their assets to fund the cost of their cancer treatment and subsequent care.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

The company’s intended customers are the physicians, and this was made evident by the study done and data showed below. This study shows the company’s target market and outlines the effectiveness of using AI in the initial diagnosis process:

Study:

17 Dermatologists across 3 clinics participated. Physicians were randomly selected into either group A or group B. Both groups treated patients and ordered biopsies when they saw fit. At the end of the study, we extracted the biopsy orders and results from the hospital’s electronic medical record and compared how often they were correct (malignant) in each of the two groups.

Study results:

A total of 1741 biopsies from 1741 individual patients (one per patient) were collected over 8 months. 
                                                  
                                 INCORRECT                CORRECT
                        

Dermatologists who did not use LCDS 
(control group)
	
   62% 
	
   38%

Dermatologists who use LCDS (intervention group)


	
   36%	
   64%                


Out of 924 biopsies reviewed by the dermatologists who did not use CDS: 38% (347/924) of the diagnoses were correct. Among the 817 biopsies reviewed by the dermatologists who did use CDS: 64% (525/817) of the diagnoses were correct (p<0.001).

Number Needed to Biopsy in the control group: 2.66
Number Needed to Biopsy in the intervention group: 1.55 
Number Needed to Biopsy in general population-based studies: 2.9 


* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Lazarus Clinical Decision Support (LCDS) is a valuable tool that can be used by the physician to make more accurate diagnoses. It has greater accuracy in classifying all types of skin lesions. Dermatologists are more likely to use such AI tool as an adjunctive screening tool before conducting biopsy. This is because the AI’s classification of the skin lesion may not be used as definitive diagnostic testing and may not replace skin biopsy nor physicians’ authority to make diagnosis. The effect of dermatologists’ AI utilization in practice can have many benefits for the patients and the physicians.

Lazarus AI’s neutral networks routinely get dermatologist level classification accuracy they also clearly explain every single decision and enabling the clinician to feel supremely comfortable with every choice they make.

With the presence of the human error and a lack of dermoscopy screening for Melanoma over telly medicine platforms is famously difficult. Lazarus CDS bridges the gap by giving the physicians who may be inclined to use the platform, a second opinion to make screening lesions over photo significantly less risk.

Lazarus CDS allows their users to filter the patients’ lesion photos by assume diagnosis confidence of the model and flags. This saves continuous hours of having to scroll through photos to find the image that the physicians are looking for compared to other competitors like who with this rapid advancement has brought with it a new set of challenges: hardware constraints, poor inference performance, high operational costs, and long development cycles. With these limitations, Lazarus Ai’s competitors have found it difficult to maximize performance and efficiency, while maintaining their model’s original accuracy, like Atidot, eBaotech and Pega who are all competitors.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Lazarus Ai is in the Insurance (InsurTech) domain.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
The global insurance industry like every other strand of commerce and government agency is feverishly focused on leveraging the benefits of a digital environment. The development and adoption of insurtech has a clearly defined progression. The first of these two phases began with a focus on digital distribution and data, the second was heavily focused on sales and marketing. Companies were forced to go digital or risk losing their market share as other companies who embrace insurtech become the industry leaders.

Those carriers that show the greatest innovations also pose considerable threat to traditional insurers’ models. This is not only because they are doing things never previously conceived, but because they have the technology working now and incumbents have yet to build — or adopt others’ — technology platforms. That may not pose an immediate problem, but insurers must start preparation now if they are not to see their businesses damaged by ‘early adopters.

Another trend to outline is the changes to ecosytems by the insurtech companies. The preeminent position held by Chinese insurtech pioneers is undeniable. Unhindered by legacy systems and processes and unburdened by the regulatory structures of more developed markets, companies like Zhong An and Ping An have been the poster boys of insurtech. Being first to market was not the secret of their success. It was founded on sound technology, nimble business practices, and one key component that has revolutionized the insurance business in China — micropayments.

Devising a customer-centric model involves making it easy, even enjoyable for customers to do business. Taking payment for digital services has, to date, been the most painful part of the exercise and can put people off completing a transaction. Biometric security has made micropayments simple for millions of consumers across the world via their mobile phones or wearable tech and now insurance must fall into step. After all, simple, painless payments can make for repeat business. The quicker and easier a transaction becomes, the happier — and more loyal — a customer becomes. It is simple human nature to be satisfied with those who do not make life difficult. Developing sound micropayment systems will help to unlock sections of the developing markets that have low current levels of insurance penetration.

While quick and easy payment is an important factor, the ecosystem that builds up around a platform will likely be what keeps customers there. Just as retail focuses on the experience rather than simply selling units, so insurance must follow. These ecosystems can offer customers a one-stop shop to conduct business and simplicity of payment is just one crucial component to building effective ecosystems. They will be one-stop online platforms, where customers not only buy insurance, but interact with social media.

China has developed a model of payments + social + mobile + data. An example is Tencent with its combination of payment, social media, and contextual messaging in a single app (WeChat). This platform generates 38 billion messages every day producing a rich source of data to feedback into insurers’ analytics engines.

The last 5-10 years have also seen the trend of divergence from legacy systems. The revolution that is coming to the insurance world is in part based on technology. But there is an increasing focus on the development of middleware solutions to reduce dependence upon legacy systems and improve access to data. These expected to be aimed at driving growth, internal efficiencies, and the internal view of how a company works. In addition, an important element of the change is the focus on improving the customer experience.
 
Another important component of this revolution is for insurers to shift their focus away from manufacturing, marketing, and selling of products to keeping the customer satisfied. This requires the industry to abandon the legacy mind-set of hundreds of years of culture. Both are going to be difficult to achieve and doing the two at the same time will likely cause a degree of angst and identity crisis.

Process improvements are expected to focus on underwriting, sales and claims, and customer engagement in the spaces between the points of transaction. This is where the data will likely be acquired that allows the automation of bespoke and on-demand coverage, improving access and reducing complexity, and thereby reducing the cost of writing such business. These new systems can segment customers largely on their behavior — how they interact with the insurer and influence the risk within their policy — rather than traditional categories of age, sex, location, ethnicity, etc. There is a need to integrate multiple solutions and partners. APIs and microservices are essential components in this process, as existing technology stacks simply do not cut it. Blockchain has become something of a buzzword, but it is not a future innovation, as it is already deployed in some flight delay and lost baggage claims systems and offers a bright future for overly complex risks such as shipping.

Further trends include the adoption of wearable tech — smart technology that monitors physical activity via apps linked to mobile technology — is beginning its own revolution within healthcare. Insurers are keen to acquire data that can help them assess, and therefore mitigate, risks. They are now partnering with customers by getting them to exchange data for premium discounts. In the US, John Hancock policies have gone one stage further by requiring fitness tracking data to be submitted. This lends credibility to wearables data as a valid new source for risk assessment, rather than simply a distribution loyalty gimmick.

Access to doctors is problematic in stretched national health services. This has resulted in insurtech being implemented into the rapidly growing telemedicine market. The benefit of insurtech in healthcare is apparent. The data gathered allows carriers to mitigate and reduce risk while influencing mutually positive behavior in the customer. The customer will likely be healthier and perhaps even live longer, while the insurer builds a more complete dataset. Early intervention can prevent the development of chronic health conditions and can provide considerable savings in claims. Better data can build better products and can also be used to remove friction points that deter consumers from buying insurance, such as a lengthy series of medical consultations before a policy is agreed upon.

A natural affinity exists between life coverage and healthcare. Higher quality healthcare and prevention of major illness can extend life, which is good for life insurers’ business. Health is currently engaged in an arms race with insurtech to offer a digital service that will allow companies to prevent, manage and eliminate risk. Insurers need to add on services to engage with customers and give them what it is they want. However, if they succeed, they will have developed new sources of growth as health is one of the few natural ecosystems insurers have. It is essential they invest outside core competencies and take risks on new business models.

The modern consumer is never off their phone and that is just how retailers like it. E-commerce has moved from being a novelty to an everyday function of most people’s lives and that is equally applicable to financial and protection services. However, insurance companies have been slow to realize the shift in behavior and how far they are from having meaningful engagement with their customers any time other than at time of renewal. 

Insurers must bridge this gap, but it is getting harder, as it is the customer who controls access. Today’s customers do not even need to decide whether to answer a call by asking the operating system to filter out contacts at certain times or from sources. The process of placing the customer at the center of an insurer's processes offers insights into what customers want, what they need, how they want to consume these products and how they like to be engaged. Though they like the immediacy of digital transactions, few customers will tolerate the incessant call center feedback loops that seem designed to meet service level agreements about call handling rather than meet customer expectations about service standards.


* What are the other major companies in this domain?
As mentioned above Zhong An and Ping An are the other major companies in this domain.

## Results: 

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Lazarus AI uses patient health data to provide Clinical Decision Support, including early cancer detection. By using its clinical decision support tools, physicians are said to be able to improve their diagnostic accuracy from 76% all the way up to 93%. The company uses deep learning and accesses millions of patient records. The business model is to sell tests and subscriptions for physicians and hospitals and sell anonymous datasets to insurance companies and research companies.

The company has four hospitals running pilots involving 27 primary care physicians. “Physicians are overwhelmed with the amount of data they have to process. Our value proposition is to make primary care doctors into specialists for five minutes,” helping them make more accurate diagnoses.


* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Some of the core metrics that are used in the Insurtech domain include:
 
Market Considerations:

Understanding how well a given InsurTech company is doing within this FinTech niche is one of the most important factors in determining its value. Market dynamics such as market size, potential market available, and growth prospects are important to understand. A valuation will consider absolute market value, existing competitors, and existing incumbents.
Company Considerations:
When valuing a start-up, quantitative information (financial and operating history) is limited; therefore, qualitative information can be extremely important in determining a company’s value. The quality and experience of the management team can be important. Knowledge of the insurance industry including understanding customer preferences, technology integration, the competitive and regulatory environments can enhance an InsurTech’s company value.
Valuation Approaches:
As InsurTech companies enhance business operations and reduce costs, valuations for these companies will become more important. There are three common approaches to determining business value: asset approach, income approach, and market approach. Each valuation approach is typically considered and then weighted accordingly to provide an indicated value or a range of value for the company, and ultimately, the specific interest or share class of the company.
-	The Asset Approach
The asset approach determines the value of a business by examining the cost that would be incurred by the relevant party to reassemble the company’s assets and liabilities. This approach is generally inappropriate for technology start-ups as they are generally not capital-intensive businesses until the company has completed funding rounds. However, it can be instructive to consider the potential costs and time that the company has undertaken to develop proprietary technology and other intangibles.
-	The Market Approach
The market approach determines the value of a company by utilizing valuation metrics from transactions in comparable companies or historical transactions in the company. Consideration of valuation metrics can provide meaningful indications for start-ups that have completed multiple funding rounds but can be complicated by different preferences and rights with different share classes.
For early-stage companies, market metrics can provide valuable insight into potential valuations and financial performance once the InsurTech company matures. For already mature enterprises, recent financial performance can be compiled to serve as a valuable benchmarking tool.
Investors can discern how the market might value an InsurTech company based on pricing information from comparable InsurTech companies or recent acquisitions of comparable InsurTech companies.
The Income Approach:
The income approach can also provide a meaningful indication of value for a FinTech company. This relies on considerations for the business’ expected cash flows, risk, and growth prospects.
The most common income approach method is the discount cash flow (DCF) method, which determines value based upon the present value of the expected cash flows for the enterprise. The DCF method projects the expected profitability of a company over a discrete period and prices the profitability using an expected rate of return, or a discount rate. The combination of present values of forecasted cash flows provides the indication of value for a specific set of assumptions.
For start-up InsurTech companies, cash flow forecasts are often characterized by a period of operating losses, capital needs, and expected payoffs as profitability improves or some exit event, like an acquisition, occurs. Additionally, investors and analysts often consider multiple scenarios for early-stage companies both in terms of cash flows and exit outcomes (IPO, sale to a strategic or financial buyer, etc.), which can lead to the use of a probability weighted expected return model (PWERM) for valuation.
Based on the metrics outlined above it can be said the Lazarus AI is performing sufficiently well with total funding generated since inception of $2.4 million, they are funded by 10 investors. The start-up has grown from two employees to now 17 in two years with Lazarus is ranked two million 500 and 26,506 among websites globally based on its 2000 452 monthly web visitors which gives rise to a 248.79% growth in monthly site visits.
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Lazarus AI is performing significantly better than competitors in the same domain and that was evident as the start-up was awarded AI world start-up winner for 2019 and has continued the growth trend with an increase in revenue over its competitors like AI.Reverie, Kyndi and Roburus.

## Recommendations:

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination!)

If I were to sign on as an advisor to Lazarus AI, I would suggest they build an entire ecosystem that enables their physicians and clinicians who use the platform to also connect with the insurances companies who offer liability insurance, critical illness insurance and the necessary health plan. In doing so, these physicians are now able to experience firsthand the probabilities of claims being made and the financial impact of the accurate diagnosis. The ecosystem would ensure these professionals who are already lacking in time be armed with all the resources needed in one app. Furthermore, another recommendation would be to allow these very physicians to sign into a referral platform where other specialist can be immediately identified for the required treatment for the client moving forward. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
The company would benefit by becoming a one stop-shop for their customer’s (physicians) medical requirements. It will give rise to efficiency and speed in treat their clients as well as providing access to a trusted platform of other specialist and physicians thus ensuring proper care to the clients are maintained. Also, ensuring the access to reputable companies for their insurance coverage, health and critical illness plans eliminates time wasting. The best quotes are being provided to their niche market for all needed medical products that the platform covers and thus keeping their customers who uses the platform content with the provided services as well as being the same tool used for ensuring the physicians clients are properly and accurately diagnosed.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
This additional technologies and service would utilize payment platforms such as:
Lement: Insurtech company helping insurance companies build digital services. 
FinLeap: Fintech company building technology companies for the banking, insurance, and asset management industries. 
Instanda: Cloud-based platform for building and releasing insurance products.
Kasko: API-powered agile insurance product and distribution platform operating between digital customer touchpoints and legacy IT systems.
Lemonade: Property and casualty insurer that returns a portion of premium in a no-claim period. 
RightIndem: Digital self-service claims platforms. 


* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
These technologies are appropriate as they provide the necessary platforms to allow the physicians to be able to access the services and products recommended. As the description above explains, these players in the industry are well placed to facilitate the best ecosystem for Lazarus AI’s clientele which are the terribly busy physician.
